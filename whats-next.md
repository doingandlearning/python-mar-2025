   - [NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)](https://www.nltk.org/) and [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/) are great libraries for starting with NLP and sentiment analysis in Python.
   - Consider a beginner project like building a sentiment analysis tool for product reviews or social media posts.
   - Kaggle also has sentiment analysis datasets and tutorials that can help you practice your skills:
     - [Sentiment Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

3. **Deep Learning with TensorFlow and PyTorch**
   - For more advanced machine learning, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) are popular frameworks.
   - Consider online courses like:
     - [DeepLearning.AI's TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) on Coursera.
     - [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) offers practical, hands-on courses with PyTorch.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Working with AWS SDK (Boto3)

Again, there's a Real Python tutorial to start you off here, https://realpython.com/python-boto3-aws-s3/ - you'll need to have access to an AWS account but there is a generous free tier to experiment with.

1. **AWS SDK for Python (Boto3)**

   - [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) is the official AWS SDK for Python. It allows you to interact with AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda.
   - Start with the Boto3 documentation and try beginner projects, such as uploading files to an S3 bucket or launching an EC2 instance.

2. **AWS Free Tier**

   - The AWS Free Tier provides limited usage of services at no cost for one year. It‚Äôs a great way to gain hands-on experience with AWS.
   - [Learn more about the AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

3. **AWS Certifications and Training**
   - AWS offers training paths for various roles, including Developer, Solutions Architect, and Machine Learning Engineer. These paths can be valuable for deepening your AWS skills.
   - [AWS Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/)

## üéØ Suggested Next Steps

1. **Build Projects**

   - Apply your skills by building small projects. For example:
     - A simple web app for sentiment analysis.
     - A command-line tool for managing files on AWS S3.
     - A machine learning model that makes predictions based on real data.

2. **Look for opportunities**
   As you head back into work, look for places where you are repeating tasks or doing something monotonous. Think about the problems you're solving and break them into smaller pieces. Can some or all of them be solved with code?

3. **Experiment and Explore**
   - Python‚Äôs versatility allows you to experiment in many areas. Continue exploring libraries and frameworks, build on your interests, and challenge yourself with new projects.

Happy coding, and good luck on your Python journey! üöÄ
